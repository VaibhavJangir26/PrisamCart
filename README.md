🚀 Project Drop: “PrismaCart” – A Modern E-Commerce Backend Built with ❤️ using TypeScript + Express + PostgreSQL! 🛍️

I’ve just wrapped up a fully functional backend project designed for e-commerce applications — clean, fast, and developer-ready! Whether you’re building with Flutter or managing scalable web apps, this backend is built to plug in and go.

🧰 Tech Behind the Scenes:
🟦 TypeScript – because strong types = fewer bugs

⚙️ Express.js – lightweight, fast, and flexible

🌐 Prisma ORM – powerful & readable DB access with PostgreSQL

🐘 PostgreSQL – scalable and rock-solid relational database

🔧 What’s Inside?
✅ Full CRUD APIs for Products
✅ Clean MVC structure for maintainability
✅ Category & pricing logic built-in
✅ Optimized for mobile devs (especially Flutter 📱)
✅ Ready to plug into your frontend — no config mess!

As a Flutter & backend developer, I wanted a real-world e-commerce starter that balances speed, structure, and simplicity. Something you can pick up, read in minutes, and ship in days.
